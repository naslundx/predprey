## Requirements and setup
Getting started is really simple. You need:

To run, start Game.py with Python. Example command: `python3 Game.py`

## Controls
Restart: `W`
4x faster speed: `Q` (hold)
Play/Pause: `Z`
To steer a player, use `M` and `N` to select a player (its name will be coloured yellow).
Up / Down / Left / Right arrow key: Choose direction.
Default choice is to move
Holding `A` means firing weapon (in current direction) - if possible
Holding `S` means jumping (in the chosen direction) - if possible

## Settings
Coming soon (Editing number of players, selecting realtime, windowless)
